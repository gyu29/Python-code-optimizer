# Code Optimizer

**Code Optimizer** is a Python-based desktop application designed to help programmers optimize their code for efficiency and readability. It integrates tools like `pylint`, `flake8`, and `autopep8` to analyze and improve code quality. Additionally, it allows users to verify the functionality of their code by running it against custom test cases, ensuring that optimizations do not alter the intended behavior. This tool is particularly useful for algorithmic programming, such as solving problems on platforms like LeetCode or Baekjoon.

## Features

- **Code Optimization**:
  - Automatically formats code using `autopep8`.
  - Provides static code analysis using `pylint` and `flake8`.
  - Suggests improvements for unused variables, inefficient loops, and more.

- **Test Case Verification**:
  - Allows users to input custom test cases.
  - Compares the output of the original and optimized code to ensure functionality remains unchanged.

- **Modern User Interface**:
  - Built with `customtkinter` for a sleek, modern look.
  - Includes a logo, icons, and customizable themes.

- **Configuration File**:
  - Uses a `config.json` file to store UI themes, fonts, and default test cases.
